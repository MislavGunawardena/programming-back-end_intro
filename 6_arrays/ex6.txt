Array indices are always integers. In the second line, a string value (instead of an integer) is specified as the index of the array element
that needs to be altered. The error message states that it is possible to implicitly convert this string value to an integer value.
The problem can be fixed by replacing the second line with the following code:
names[3] = 'jody'
